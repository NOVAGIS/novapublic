IN-CLASS EXERCISE 2
-----------------
  
Scenario:  
Only minutes ago, a criminal escaped from Lisbon Prison. She is within one kilometer of the prison. We want to place roadblocks along the perimeter of this zone at every street. Each checkpoint needs one police officer. Provide the location of each checkpoint and a count of the number of officers needed.

Turn in:  
An Esri map package of location of checkpoints and your ModelBuilder Model. Your data and workflow model should be contained in a single file geodatabase. Delete the buildings data from your geodatabase to make the file much smaller. Upload your work to ArcGIS Online, make it publicly accessible, and submit the link. Please source your map data; for instance, if you are using OpenStreetMap road data, include the note: Road data, Copyright 2013 OpenStreetMap Contributors; Shapefile extract from Geofabrik.de. 
  
This in-class assignment is due 24 September 2013 at 6:30PM. I suggest you turn it in immediately following class.
  
GIS Workflow: in-class demo & discussion
  
Grab the data: http://bit.ly/158Noah (or via http://dra.in/lab2.mpk)
  
Step 1. Obtain street and building data. Where?  
Step 2. Transform data into a useful coordinate system. Which?  
Step 3. Load the data into a geodatabase. Pause a moment to review file formats.  
Step 4. Locate the prison.  
Step 5. Create a 1-km buffer around the prison.  
Step 6. Now what?  
Step 7. ?  
Step 8. ?  
  
The Scenario Changes:
Minutes have passed. We need to move our roadblocks to four kilometers. Automate the process in case we need to move the checkpoints again. Provide your solution with your other deliverables.

LAB 2
-----------------
Part 1.
The mayor of Matosinhos, Portugal, is concerned about pollution coming from factories along the river, Rio Le√ßa, upstream of the town. The River is one of the most polluted in Europe. Could you identify industrial landuse within one kilometer of the river and provide her the number of square kilometers? two kilometers from the river? three? Upload a map package to ArcGIS Online, make it public, and include any toolboxes you have created. Send a link and a short discussion of your work. Suppose you used OpenStreetMap data for your analysis; in 150 words or less, explain how the estimation of industrial landuse area could be improved?

Part 2. 
Using all your GIS and cartographic prowess, create a choropleth map of estimated world population for the year 2005. Send me a note about how you created your map and submit the map as a pdf, png, or weblink. Provide reasoning for the projection you chose. Warning: For this exercise, using the Web Mercator projection is unacceptable.

Part 3.
Create a geodatabase of roads for an area of 5km x 5km centered on Nairobi, Kenya. Provide all data within an appropriate coordinate system for performing citywide analysis. Send a map package of the geodatabase with a note explaining how you created it (source and choice of coordinate system).

All three parts of this lab must be submitted within a single e-mail. If you cannot make your attachments of small enough size, make them available to me using Dropbox or Google Drive. However, if you use that approach, provide me detailed instructions on how to acquire the files and what I am supposed to download.

Part 4. Place data for roads and paths of the Kibera neighborhood (slum) in you Github account in GeoJSON format. Send me a link to the file. Hint: If you load a shapefile into QGIS, you can "Save As" GeoJSON.

Lab 2 is due at 6:30PM on 25 September 2013.

ONLINE CAMPUS MAP PROJECT
---------------------

Given a ten week timeframe, provide three possible projects of appropriate scope for the improvement of the NOVA online campus map.

For each proposal:

* Your name
* Offer a project title
* Define the project's purpose
* Provide a preliminary list of data, resources, and tools necessary to complete the project.
* Outline a timeline of the project's completion. For example,
	Week 1: Project Formulation and Selection
	Week 2: Project Scope and Methods Refinement
	Week 3 Assemble Available data sources / create working base map
	Week 4: Collect and process field data
	Week 5: Upload project to ArcGIS Server
	Week 6: Create process model for online service
	Week 7&8: Work on user interface and cartography; Testing
	Week 9: Finalize; upload to production server
	Week 10: Write and Present project report

Write a sentence or two on your preferred project; provide reasoning -- particularly with respect to the cost/benefits of the proposal and ability to complete the task by November 26. Is your project more suitable for individual or group work?

Send each of your proposals as a text file attachment. Use modest formatting to ensure each file is readable. Only simple .txt files will be accepted.

Due 24 September 2013 at noon.
