Applied GIS Homework, Lab 1
Due 18 September 2013, 03:30

Class Discussion Preparation:
Examine the UNL online campus map at: http://labnt02.isegi.unl.pt/GeoTech/Apps/UNLCampolide/ (also accessible via a button "Campus Campolide" on the site's right side at: http://www.unl.pt). Come to class on 17 September 2013, with suggestions for improvement of the map. Consider what such a map should do and be. All students will be expected to contribute to the discussion. Examination of other campus maps and their associated services could be a productive means for brainstorming the problem, and a web search of (online campus map) yields many results. Please think deeply about the issue.

Lab 1:
For this lab, you are the instructor. Create a GIS software exercise that demonstrates three standard geospatial analytical operations. Make the lab follow a single use case or narrative (for example, an urban planning, hydrology, or demographics use case), and yield a meaningful result. Use a step-by-step style that explains to the user what is happening in each significant step. The lab should be fully functional with links to data sources and any other necessary materials. You may discuss the project with your classmates, but each of you is responsible for submitting a new, personal, original work. Submit the lab via e-mail as a MS Word document, pdf, or Github repository link.
