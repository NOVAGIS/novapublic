In-class Exercise 7 (Due 29 October 2013)
Determine the distance between two lat/long pairs (given as decimal degrees) in kilometers. You may treat the earth as a sphere. Extend myapi.php to create and document an API that calculates geodesic distance. Attach a copy of your myapi.php file to your submission. Turn in the assignment via an e-mail under the subject line: In-class Exercise 7

Lab 4 (Due 5 November 2013)
A. Map the new parking lot.
B. Include a visualization of the control points and their positional uncertainties; also include any control point data collected by the Android app. These points are at: http://54.200.201.232/parking.txt
C. Turn in a zipped geodatabase of the parking lot (data formats other than Esri are fine as long as open source platforms for their manipulation are available). Provide metadata; that is, give an explanation of what's in the geodatabase, estimated accuracy of the data and sources, and how it was created.
D. In 2015, GeoMundus will be at UNL. Create a beautiful map of UNL's Campolide Campus targeted toward this group. Place your map as a PNG on your server or Github account. Write a paragraph about how your map was created. Submit via e-mail under the subject line: Lab 4

Project Progress Report (Due 29 October 2013)
Identify a tool or technique you need to learn for the campus map. Perform some training or a tutorial that takes 2-3 hours. Show me that you completed it. Send certificate/map/results via an e-mail under the subject: Progress Report 6.

Next week: more-sophisticated online databases and queries. We also will do a map deconstruction. Find an interesting online map and bring a weblink to the class on 29 Oct 2013. We'll reverse engineer the tools and techniques used in creating the map.
